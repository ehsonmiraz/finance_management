    **To calculate the savings:**

    $$
    \text{savings} = \left( \frac{\text{net income of the month}}{\text{number of days in the current month}} - \frac{\text{total debited amount of the current month}}{\text{current day}} \right) \times \text{current day}
    $$

    **To calculate the savings goal progress percentage:**

    $$
    \text{savings goal progress percentage} =  \left( \frac{\text{savings}}{\text{goal target amount}} \right) \times 100
    $$
